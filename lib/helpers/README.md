# CelebFitLife Helper Functions

This directory contains helper functions used throughout the CelebFitLife application. These helpers handle Firebase interactions and other business logic operations.

## Available Helpers

## File Structure

- `auth.ts` - Authentication-related helpers
- `dashboard.ts` - Dashboard data fetching helpers

## Best Practices

1. **Error handling**: All helpers should include proper error handling with consistent error response structures.
2. **TypeScript typing**: Use proper TypeScript types for parameters and return values.
3. **Function documentation**: Document all functions with JSDoc comments.
4. **Keep functions pure**: When possible, make functions pure and focused on a single responsibility.
5. **Consistent return values**: Maintain a consistent pattern for return values (e.g., using `{ success, error }` objects).
6. **Logging**: Include appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring.
7. **Parameter validation**: Validate input parameters to prevent errors.
8. **Handle edge cases**: Ensure helpers handle edge cases gracefully.
9. **Use async/await**: Prefer async/await for asynchronous operations over Promises.

## Adding New Helpers

When adding new helpers, consider:
1. Is the helper focused on a specific domain (e.g., streams, auth, payments)?
2. Should it be grouped with existing helpers or placed in a new file?
3. Is it properly typed and documented?
4. Does it follow the error handling pattern used in existing helpers?
5. Does it include proper logging for debugging?
6. Is it thoroughly tested with edge cases?
